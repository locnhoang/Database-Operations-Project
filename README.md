# Database-Operations-Project
As part of CSE 4701, I developed a Python script using mysql.connector to interact with a mock company database in MySQL. The program enables users to perform secure database operations such as adding, removing, and modifying employees, dependents, and departments, while supporting record locking for updates. It also includes a menu driven interface for executing multiple operations and offers the option to automatically save changes after each transaction.
